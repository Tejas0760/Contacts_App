# Contacts Application 

I developed a dynamic web-based application using Spring Boot that empowers users to manage their contacts effortlessly. By integrating OAuth 2.0 for Single Sign-On, users can quickly sign up with their email, Gmail, or GitHub credentials, enhancing the overall experience.

Once registered, users can easily add, edit, and delete contacts while enjoying features like cloud image uploads for contact photos. To ensure smooth interactions, I implemented robust form validation, requiring users to enter valid phone numbers and follow specific input guidelines. I also added a dark mode feature, making the interface visually appealing and comfortable for low-light settings.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable skills in Spring Boot, OAuth 2.0, cloud storage, form validation, and user interface design. This experience deepened my technical expertise and fueled my passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly applications.
